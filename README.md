# IP Address Tracker Challenge

This project is a challenge for Frontend Mentor - it displays various geographic data and a map with a marker for a given ip address (defaulting to the IP of the client device).

## Getting Started

### Setup

First, you'll need to have a valid API key for `ipify`. You can set up an account for free on [their website](https://www.ipify.org/).

Create a `.env.local` file and add the variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` with your API key as the value.

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
